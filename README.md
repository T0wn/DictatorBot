# DictatorBot

This is a personal discordbot used to terrorize the members of my discord server.

The bots main function is to keep people trapped in a voice channel.
It achives this by removing the roles and privileges of the target when he/she is moved into the voice channel named "Skammekroken" by an admin.
The target no longer has privileges to join or see other voice channels.
When an admin moves the target out of "Skammekroken" the bot will automatically give back roles and privileges.

As an extra feature the [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaLSdYNqGuQ) from the famous "shame" sceene in Game of thrones
is played by the bot whenever someone joins "Skammekroken".

Here is an example of how the bot works:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Admins perspective</td>
    <td>Users perspective</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="./images/dictatorbot_example_admin.gif"> </td>
    <td> <img src="./images/dictatorbot_example_user.gif"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
